We are seeking someone interested in plant biology and data analysis to help process and measure digitized plant samples using both external and internal analysis tools. Many of our projects involve high-throughput phenotyping. As such, a desirable candidate would be capable of writing reusable, efficient, and well-commented code. The successful candidate will be organized, independent, creative, have strong communication skills, desire to learn, and work with outstanding collaborative capability.

Much of the data in our lab are 3D reconstructed volumes from our large-format X-ray Tomography (XRT) system and X-ray microscope (XRM) system, but we handle a variety of other types of data depending on the project (e.g. genomics data, PET images, hyperspectral images). Given the size and variety of data in the lab, this job involves maintaining a robust computational infrastructure–including dedicated workstations, storage and processing servers, virtual machines, internal code bases, third-party software licenses, VR systems, databases, and data management. The role allows for creativity and autonomy in the design and development of tools and procedures.",4.3,"Donald Danforth Plant Science Center
